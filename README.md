# 🏔️ Sentiment Analysis & Risk Assessment of Everest Climbing Incidents

A comprehensive analysis using web scraping, data wrangling, sentiment analysis, and visualization to investigate climbing incidents and reporting on **Mount Everest**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project aims to analyze accident and fatality trends on Mount Everest by:
- Scraping and aggregating data from **Wikipedia** and **American Alpine Club**.
- Cleaning and structuring the dataset to identify key risk factors.
- Applying **sentiment analysis** using VADER to analyze climbing reporting.
- Generating visualizations for data-driven insights.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Most climbering reporters demonstrated neutral or slightly positive sentiments in their reports because fatal accidents are not as common as people think they are.
- **Fatality Trends:** Climbing fatalities are more likely to occur during the spring season and at times, because of a natural catastrophe or mismanagement by governments.
- **Accident Patterns:** Accidents peak during climbing seasons, with inexperienced climbers facing higher risks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, VADER, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Web Scraping:** Wikipedia, American Alpine Club records
- **Sentiment Analysis:** VADER for text polarity and sentiment
- **Visualization Tools:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, WordCloud
