# 🏔️ Mount Everest Risk Analytics: Business Intelligence for Adventure Tourism

**A data-driven analysis combining web scraping, sentiment analysis, and statistical insights to understand climbing risks and optimize safety decision-making.**

*Business Analytics Portfolio Project | University of Notre Dame*

## 📈 **Executive Summary**

This project analyzes Mount Everest climbing data to identify key risk factors and trends that could inform business decisions in adventure tourism, insurance, and expedition planning. By combining incident data with sentiment analysis of climbing reports, the project delivers actionable insights for industry stakeholders.

**Key Business Value:**
- **Death Spike Analysis:** Identified and analyzed three major casualty events (2006, 2015, 2023) with distinct triggers
- **Weather Paradox Discovery:** Uncovered counter-intuitive finding that "safe" spring season has substantially higher death rates
- **Market Intelligence:** Analyzed sentiment patterns in expedition reports to understand reporting accuracy
- **Risk Reframing:** Challenged conventional industry assumptions about seasonal safety and expedition timing

## 🎯 **Business Problem & Approach**

**Problem:** Adventure tourism companies and insurance providers need better data to understand and price Everest climbing risks, but current decision-making relies heavily on anecdotal evidence.

**My Approach:**
1. **Data Collection:** Scraped 23 years of casualty data (2000-2023) from Wikipedia and American Alpine Club
2. **Trend Analysis:** Mapped death rate fluctuations to identify significant spike years and patterns
3. **Seasonal Investigation:** Analyzed seasonal death rates to test conventional "safe season" assumptions
4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Applied VADER scoring to expedition reports to understand reporting reliability
5. **Business Translation:** Connected analytical discoveries to actionable industry recommendations

## 📊 **Key Findings & Business Insights**

### **Death Rate Fluctuation Analysis:**
- **Major Incident Years:** Identified three significant casualty spikes in the data (2000-2023):
  - **2006:** "The Year of Controversy" - Policy and management issues led to increased fatalities
  - **2015:** "The Everest Earthquake Disaster" - Natural disaster caused unprecedented casualties  
  - **2023:** "The Modern Everest Crisis" - Recent surge highlighting ongoing safety challenges
- **Trend Patterns:** Death rates show cyclical fluctuations with identifiable triggers for major spikes

### **The Weather Paradox Discovery:**
- **Counter-Intuitive Finding:** Spring season, traditionally considered "safer," actually recorded substantially more deaths than expected
- **Business Implication:** Current industry assumptions about seasonal safety may be flawed
- **Risk Assessment Gap:** Adventure tourism operators may be underpricing spring expedition risks

### **Sentiment Intelligence:**
- **Report Distribution:** 68% neutral sentiment, 23% positive, 9% negative in expedition reports
- **Reporting Insight:** Neutral-toned reports tend to provide more accurate risk information
- **Communication Patterns:** Language analysis reveals how incident severity correlates with reporting tone

### **Strategic Business Applications:**
- **Insurance Pricing:** Seasonal risk assumptions need revision based on spring casualty data
- **Expedition Planning:** Weather paradox findings challenge conventional scheduling wisdom
- **Safety Protocols:** Spike year analysis provides framework for identifying high-risk periods
- **Market Positioning:** Data-driven safety insights could differentiate expedition operators
